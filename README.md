# GNSS Signals Control And Monitoring (Frontend)
This is a frontend part of software that is designed to control and monitor GNSS signals.

The project is part of my current job as a fullstack developer and is under development. Due to some confidential information, <b>this repo won't be updated</b>, but it is considered to be an example of my skills.

## Before you start :warning:
This project was moved from a private Gitlab server and edited to remove references to the names of some entities.
Since the backend cannot be moved from a private server, the frontend is not fully functional as it is powered by a continuous stream of information packets.
If you run a project demo, then almost all sections will contain the message "No data".


However, this repository is meant <b>to show my experience</b> with <b>Vue.js, TypeScript, and Axios</b> as of self-learner, so feel free to browse through the sources!
